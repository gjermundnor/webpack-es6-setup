# Basic Webpack config with ES6 setup
Just a really basic setup to get started. 
Made for personal use and preferences, but free for anyone to clone and use.

## Getting started
1. `npm install`
2. Dev server `npm start`
2. Production build `npm run build`
3. Visible at `localhost:8080` or `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`
4. Should output `It works!`
